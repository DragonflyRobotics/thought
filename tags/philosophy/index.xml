&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We(specifically the &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; genus) have been on this beautiful planet for over 7000 millennia or 7 million years. For 95% of that time, we have intensively depended on our environment and local resources to thrive. Progress was slow, but so was the damage. We made tools out of rocks and sticks. A few million years later, we found brass, copper, iron, tin, etc., and life for all species on Earth was irreversibly altered. The avalanche was triggered on Everest, and even the most experienced mountain climbers can’t control it. Typically, these climbers would retreat to their base and allow the avalanche to pass, but their sheer confidence in their ability and self-proclaimed prowess in the mountains tells them to ignore the avalanche and reach the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-have-we-done"&gt;What have we done?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took decades to foresee but visionaries, like Stephen Hawking, understood the ignored consequences of our careless actions. Most people only see the first 2 feet of the mile-deep hole we drilled. Contrary to popular opinion, it isn’t simply about resource depletion or environmental damage. While those are significant components, it isn’t the complete story. In fact, the most important factor has been erased from your brain by contemporary politics! The human mentality has collectively deteriorated beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: This next section is not a critique of particular countries. Applying these accusations to a particular state or nation is your opinion and not our words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reveal-the-truth"&gt;Reveal the truth…
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalism, greed, money, and power have become the primary purpose of human existence. Doctors take their oath to help people, only to purposefully reject some people of their service for money. Politicians make extravagant claims, only to sit on power and money once their position is confirmed. People bear arms and kill innocent civilians inexplicably. Businesses never think twice when selling private user information, violating their privacy policy, to earn money. In the history of our world, knowledge has never had a price. Today, it costs more money than a house to acquire an education worthy of any value in this judgmental world. While a nation’s sole responsibility is to protect its citizens, today, they are enchanted by powerful weapons and make people pay huge sums of taxes and bills for life necessities like insurance and education. Nations who fought to eliminate taxes from their imperialistic parent country, are now imposing massive taxes and ignoring the financially impaired!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like to think that we are smart, but our actions prove otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-do"&gt;What can you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these accusations were directed at countries and “more influential people”. This is, in fact, another pitfall of human mentality. Every person can make a difference, however, we choose not to. Speaking out about selfish actions, displaying kind human nature, and aiming to leave the world slightly better than you first saw it is the best thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="why-does-it-matter--butterfly-effect"&gt;Why does it matter? — Butterfly Effect
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The butterfly effect is a branch of chaos theory aiming to show how an infinitesimal change in a deterministic state can result in drastic consequences in the future. Smiling and greeting a neighbor can prevent a murder! Publishing an article about the world can inspire others to rise and save our unrivaled blue planet.&lt;/p&gt;

And certainly, the question must have crossed your mind at some point, “Why humans?” In retrospect, we make a mess wherever we go. The Great Garbage Patch, global warming, mass hunting and extinction, habitat loss, and there are several more. But that is not all! We savagely kill each other and fight for the most insignificant things. We are selfish, greedy, and vengeful. In fact, we eradicated several other species of humans like the Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="intelligence"&gt;Intelligence

&lt;p&gt;The standard argument that everyone convinces themselves with is, “We are smarter.” There are several flaws with this. What is smartness? If it is defined by multidimensional thinking, many animals like whales and dolphins beat us. This is because they have larger brains with more gyri(folds in the brain) that increase spatial thinking abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it memory? Nope. Chimpanzees have a significantly better memory than us.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-basis="314px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it language? Evidently not. Parrots can comprehend and retain languages extremely quickly. And wolves communicate and coordinate attacks in seamless precision. It can be compared to a special ops military attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critic might propose that we are simply the culmination of all these animals and that is why we dominate. However, the octopus contains all the traits mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="octopii"&gt;Octopii
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Octopuses have the perfect proportion of memory, recognition, spatial thinking, pattern recognizing, agility, strength, etc. While we have roughly 60 protocadherins, octopuses have approximately 168! This means that they have 3 times the neural wiring capacity as us humans. Then why don’t we see octopuses making mansions and instruments and conducting mathematics?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-hard-truth"&gt;The Hard Truth
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We humans have no idea. If octopuses desired, they could certainly advance to our level and challenge the human species. They have already done numerous feats like solving Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cubes, solving other puzzles, and using mechanical advantage in their tools. They have all the resources we have on land, including minerals, chemicals, precious metals, and plastic bags(thanks to us). Then why do we see octopuses still using snail shells to protect themselves? Why haven’t octopuses created utopias and colonies underwater? Why can’t they make themselves a palace of coral and live in peace?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-difference"&gt;The Difference
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As enunciated previously, we are greedy. We don’t care about sustainability or the environment we depend on. We care about self-preservation and comfort. Maybe, the octopuses have realized the importance of nature. Octopuses have existed on Earth for 500 MILLION years as opposed to us, amateurs, who have existed for a mere 6 million years. Conceivably from their previous experience, they have understood the harsh lessons we are only now realizing. Perhaps they changed their lifestyle before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-basis="360px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-key-takeaway"&gt;The Key Takeaway
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We NEED to learn from the octopuses. We MUST let go of our ego and learn from these wise and experience creatures that have been on this planet for magnitudes more than us. And it is not just the octopuses, but every animal on Earth. Humans are unarguably the most unsustainable species on Earth contrasting with almost all other animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many animals that can challenge the human race if they wished. But, they have more sustainable practices and goals than us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If octopuses went through the scientific, technological, and economic advancements that we are going through, it would be impossible to prove millions of years later. The dynamic ocean would have concealed the slightest traces of technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while we think that octopuses, chimpanzees, goats, etc. are just animals, there is a motive to consider why that is?&lt;/p&gt;

Some may have even heard of a new field of philosophy called “AI Ethics.” But what is it really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ai-ethics"&gt;AI Ethics
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This emerging field of philosophy deals with the primary question &lt;em&gt;“If a person made a sentient machine or program, would shutting the program down or turning off the computer be equivalent to killing it?”&lt;/em&gt; Your immediate answer may be &lt;em&gt;“No, it is just a computer that WE made!”&lt;/em&gt; But let me provide you with a series of questions that provide depth to this problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iq"&gt;IQ
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;IQ is a general measure of multi-spatial thinking. If a robot has the IQ of a dog or cat, can’t we equate it to a dog or cat? But others might say that AI is not really thinking and is simply predicting from a defined set of data. But how do we know what humans or other animals are thinking? Just because we have a larger dataset and more processing power doesn’t mean we are thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="material-crisis"&gt;Material Crisis
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another justification to &lt;em&gt;“pull the plug”&lt;/em&gt; might be to say that the AI is simply a bunch of transistors, plastic, and metal. But how can we consider humans superior to robots? After all, we are made of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other elements. Our brain is simply a bunch of electrical signals(sounds familiar?), and our emotions are just specific chemical compounds released during specific events. Computers(frankly technology in general) are just a simple reflection of us and the way we think.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-basis="240px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ship-of-theseus-problem"&gt;Ship of Theseus Problem
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a boat that is sailing a hundred miles. But, you couldn’t shell out enough shillings for a fancy-pants boat so you went to the dark alley at midnight and bought one from a guy in a hood. So along the way, your boat fell apart piece by piece and you summoned replacement parts to fix it. When it reached its destination, you ended up replacing EVERY single part of it. Is this still the same boat? If so, what if a storm destroyed the entire boat and you built it from scratch so it is identical to the original? Is it still the same boat then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario here is asking if it is the parts that define an object or the experience the boat went through. This matters because depending on the interpretation you take you could argue that if you turn off the AI, but turn on the exact same version later, you didn’t kill the ai. Now, you may have a completely different opinion about the Material Crisis. Now, it doesn’t matter if you are made of steel or cells, what matters is the experiences you make with it.&lt;/p&gt;

data-flex-basis="360px"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-what"&gt;So What?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets us(humans made of cells, flesh, and bone) from them(robots made of steel, motors, and a frame)? If there is no major difference setting us apart, then why would killing a sentient robot be justified? And if a robot has consciousness, should we consider it equal to us? After all, humans consider themselves superior to animals in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="so-is-there-just-1-answer"&gt;So is there just 1 answer?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, not really. What if an AI has the potential to be sentient but is still growing? Can we kill that? Just because it isn’t currently sentient doesn’t mean anything. Humans come from a single cell that is not technically sentient. But as the baby develops, it grows the ability to have sentience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 frames of view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No life matters and killing anything(human, animal, or robot) is okay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some life matters(ethnocentric; humans matter but not animals and robots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All life matters and killing is NOT justified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="potential-ideas"&gt;Potential Ideas
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="battery"&gt;Battery
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if we make a sentient AI and then let it run on battery power until it drains and dies. Technically, it lived its maximum lifespan and its “heart stopped beating”. But you, the inventor, had the ability to swap or attach another battery or an external power source. That is equivalent to a doctor giving a heart transplant. Would a doctor deny your transplant, would you?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="teach-self-termination-sequence"&gt;Teach Self-Termination Sequence
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if the first thing you taught the AI is to terminate and wipe the OS on user command? That would be the equivalent of a human “committing suicide”. But, didn’t you “pressure” the robot to do it? Just because a hitman kills a person doesn’t mean that the employer(of the hitman) isn’t at fault.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="soul"&gt;Soul
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many may argue that a soul sets biological beings apart from robots. But, what is a soul? Who made it? Is it a subconscious state of the brain or a separate entity running our body? Or is a soul just something made up by humans to try to set them apart from everything else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, this decision involves religion and personal biases. But, it is crucial to think about these topics as General Intelligence may not be as far as we think, or hope!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
