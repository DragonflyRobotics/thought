&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a goal, a goal impossible to reach. A goal scholar pursues their entire existence, knowing its unfeasibility. It is the peak of the highest mountain that mountaineers, weak and strong alike, climb, knowing their grave lies amidst the snow. It is a thought that intoxicates all who see its value and allows them to persevere through the climb to conquer more of the mountain and accept their ascertained defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is the pinnacle of thought and understanding of everything that is to be understood. Knowledge about the small atoms that work in unison to produce marvelous chemical machines, to the grand universe of unfathomable complexity. Knowledge about the predictable day after a long night to the stochasticity of the clouds encompassing our globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a key. A key that unlocks opportunity itself. From a simple job interview to the cure for cancer, it holds the very secret to things humans value most. A small, golden key in a world made of locks. Knowledge is key to every job, family, conversation, culture, achievement, and goal humans can think of, yet it remains a goal impossible to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a beacon that illuminates the path to all human desires. A beacon so bright as to irradiate outer space and the abyssal depths of the ocean. It is a tool that can show an enlightening path to peace and prosperity and the inhumane weapons of war. A beacon that — not only sheds light on the path ahead — but also illuminates the characteristics of the person holding the torch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some might say that knowledge is attainable in a topic of smaller scope, to say that a subset of an infinite expanse of knowledge is finite would be to say that the human race has perfected certain fields, and nothing new can be obtained from them. A complete understanding of a certain field would require a complete understanding of knowledge itself since every component of this universe is linked — often in subtle ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is a question as old as time itself. It materializes in many forms, from the inherent order in nature to “Cogito, ergo sum.” It is an existential question, unanswerable by even the greatest intellect. It is a question that trumps all questions in comparison, whose answer unlocks the very mysteries of nature itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some think they have attained knowledge, and many more believe it is attainable in a human lifespan, we must consider the minuscule role we play in the infinite expanse of our universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We(specifically the &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; genus) have been on this beautiful planet for over 7000 millennia or 7 million years. For 95% of that time, we have intensively depended on our environment and local resources to thrive. Progress was slow, but so was the damage. We made tools out of rocks and sticks. A few million years later, we found brass, copper, iron, tin, etc., and life for all species on Earth was irreversibly altered. The avalanche was triggered on Everest, and even the most experienced mountain climbers can’t control it. Typically, these climbers would retreat to their base and allow the avalanche to pass, but their sheer confidence in their ability and self-proclaimed prowess in the mountains tells them to ignore the avalanche and reach the summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-have-we-done"&gt;What have we done?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took decades to foresee but visionaries, like Stephen Hawking, understood the ignored consequences of our careless actions. Most people only see the first 2 feet of the mile-deep hole we drilled. Contrary to popular opinion, it isn’t simply about resource depletion or environmental damage. While those are significant components, it isn’t the complete story. In fact, the most important factor has been erased from your brain by contemporary politics! The human mentality has collectively deteriorated beyond repair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reveal-the-truth"&gt;Reveal the truth…
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capitalism, greed, money, and power have become the primary purpose of human existence. Doctors take their oath to help people, only to purposefully reject some people of their service for money. Politicians make extravagant claims, only to sit on power and money once their position is confirmed. People bear arms and kill innocent civilians inexplicably. Businesses never think twice when selling private user information, violating their privacy policy, to earn money. In the history of our world, knowledge has never had a price. Today, it costs more money than a house to acquire an education worthy of any value in this judgmental world. While a nation’s sole responsibility is to protect its citizens, today, they are enchanted by powerful weapons and make people pay huge sums of taxes and bills for life necessities like insurance and education. Nations who fought to eliminate taxes from their imperialistic parent country, are now imposing massive taxes and ignoring the financially impaired!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-do"&gt;What can you do?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these accusations were directed at countries and “more influential people”. This is, in fact, another pitfall of human mentality. Every person can make a difference, however, we choose not to. Speaking out about selfish actions, displaying kind human nature, and aiming to leave the world slightly better than you first saw it is the best thing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the year 1980, and all software engineers worldwide were excited at a new frontier of technology: Artificial Intelligence. The ability for the “Perceptron” to be fed a bunch of images and teach itself to recognize different simple objects was revolutionary. Visionaries foresaw the full future dominated by this intelligence. As computing power grew, promptly with the advent of parallel computing and dense silicon chips, so grew people’s ambitions. And, from these ambitions came the inevitable question: Is it possible for an AI to think, learn, and react like a living thing, even better, a human?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-concern"&gt;The Concern
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As novels and movies came out, concern spread like wildfire. People shunned the idea of thinking computers, fearing the ultimate demise of the human race. In the arms race for intelligence, there is no room for error. As this concern grew, these enthusiastic engineers left this idea as a hopeless venture for the future, when the public opinion isn’t as harsh. As foreseeable, the opinion faded away, as people focused on more prevalent issues to riot over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-resurgence"&gt;The Resurgence
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With renewed confidence and contemporary technology to bolster such progress, new AI research companies emerged, namely Deepmind and OpenAI. These companies often partnered with then-emerging tech giants like Intel, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and Nvidia. Powerful feats were achieved to demark the prowess of modern ingenuity and sophistication in algorithmic mathematics and AI. This field of study was suddenly more accepted by the community and was permitted to grow. Institutions around the globe researched new ways to automate their labor-intensive tasks. Convolutions, GANs, Transformers, and Markov chains soon flooded the market with opportunities. It was as if the collective field of AI grew in intelligence. As AIs performed better, and more efficiently, they also became more accessible. Companies incorporated these models in their advertisements, user management systems, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="modern-ai"&gt;Modern AI
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the release of OpenAI’s GPT3 and the new almighty Deepmind Gato, people started claiming the invention of General Intelligence. People believe that General Intelligence is when an AI can do several, seemingly unrelated tasks, independently. Just because GPT3 can write code, draw pictures, and write completely original stories doesn’t mean that it is approaching the intelligence of a human being. Quite the contrary actually!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-general-intelligence"&gt;What is General Intelligence?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, there are several non-intuitive definitions made. True general intelligence is the ability of a machine to automatically acquire and train itself on a vast variety of knowledge that it may acquire from any source. It must also be able to make new predictions on the data upon inquisition (direct or indirect). This machine may not start with any pre-trained models, data, etc. OpenAI and Deepmind have made incredible progress and their feats are irrefutable evidence of innovation. But, they were trained on carefully procured data made by humans. This is what disqualifies it from the most comprehensive and logical definition of General Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robotics, put simply, is the combination of electrical, software, and mechanical engineering to make tasks easier. But, the amount of robots being used in repetitive tasks in warehouses and factories is exponentially growing. This begs the question, will the rapid popularization of automation diminish the need for humans?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-do-people-do-these-jobs"&gt;Why do People do These Jobs?
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, people are compelled to do these jobs due to their unfortunate economic conditions. Debt from school, high unemployment due to a desperate global economy, and low levels of education can all put people in these types of jobs. People need the money to survive and a spiraling concern is their ensuing replacement by machines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the general public only knows a fraction of the true potential of robotics. Some AIs create perfectly synthetic art from a single sentence description. Others make hyper-realistic human faces and write code for you just from a description! Some robots mow your lawn, weld entire car frames together, and even make Falcon 9 rockets that go to space. AIs have been used to design and manufacture the very airplanes you fly in. The advertisements we see are custom generated for each user using cookies and digital biometrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the insane advancements in robotics, a technological revolution akin to this one has happened before. The industrial revolution, in particular, the advent of the steam engine sharply reduced the need for physical labor. The cotton gin and the mechanized loom left hundreds of thousands unemployed, and because of this people found new jobs to maintain the machines. In fact, this drastically increased the mean education level of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

When they talk about global domination by robots or job loss due to advances in robotics, their assumptions are highly based on science fiction and not that much on reality. In fact, robotics is an indistinguishable part of our lives and essential to us in a controlled manner. Whether you are strongly against anything related to robotics or are a lead engineer at &lt;a class="link" href="https://bostondynamics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, it is indisputable that robotics is in our everyday lives.

&lt;p&gt;Everything from a toaster, to your computer, there is some form of robotics in it. For example, while you are browsing on Amazon and it suggests you exactly what you are looking for, you witnessed AI. AI has just helped you and Amazon. After introducing this AI, Amazon saw a 29% increase in sales and $12.83 billion more dollars in revenue. This shows that AI is helping customers like you and companies like Amazon earn money. In fact, our lives are also at the hands of AI. Boeing and other companies are creating more efficient airplane air-frames using AI. They have trained the AI to take their requirements and it will design the most perfect air-frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Boeing, their new Boeing 777 will be 100% computer generated and assembled online before they even bring out the materials! In fact, the computer will even create a special mixture of metals and composites to make the air-frame lighter! Look around, every item near you is probably manufactured in a factory. In the year 2020 alone, 1.64 million industrial robots are used in factories around the globe and analytics say that they will replace 20 million factory jobs by 2030! This raises the concern that our interdependence might lead to severe problems depicted by literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ethical aspect of AI has been an extremely controversial topic. There is great hope that AI can personalize school learning plans, help disabled people, and revolutionize our lives, but there must be a balance. At a deeper level, AI is just a math equation that runs behind it but its ability to gradually learn is one fact that concerns many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though, if AI can be used conservatively and concisely, the severity of the consequence may be minimal. That raises a question though; as human beings, we are very curious, and we will strive to learn more and eventually lead to problems much greater than our imagination. But how severe is severe?&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That rhetorical question has quite a simple answer. AI is being developed in individual parts like some work on vision while others work on speech. Other engineers work on the robotic humanoid part. When a person gets the idea of combining all the parts, he/she will make a close replica of a human, and if not given the right knowledge of ethics and society, the robot will believe that it is one of us. As humans are quite violent, in the sense that we are always fighting each other, the robots will do the same. Many people discriminate, the robots will do the same. They will be our replica only made of metal and 100 times stronger. This is what we fear and if not controlled, we won’t have to watch movies to fear it.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, the question is not whether AI is ethical but rather where is the limit. We must learn to live within boundaries and know that exceeding them can have grave consequences. The research our scientists have done is truly incredible but only to a limit. The next time you pull out a mobile phone or any other device, remember our interdependence with it and its similarity to any other robot or AI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
